[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:47 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findruckig.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "ruckig", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ruckig" with any
  of the following names:

    ruckigConfig.cmake
    ruckig-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ruckig" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ruckig_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "ruckig"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
